# MNIST-CNN-Experiment
A python code was written wherein MNIST handwritten digits were to be recognized. 32000 samples were given for the training of the network and the modelâ€™s accuracy was evaluated on Kaggle using 10000 different samples as the test set. Keras library with Theano backend was used for performing the simulations. A deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture was developed and used for the training of the network.
